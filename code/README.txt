>main-0.3b.m computes the probability distributions of resistance, functionality and recoverability for ranges of parameters of these properties using the full JPD
its input is:
-model_choice, a string
-observation_vector, a vector of integers
-experiments, an integer number

>main-0.2b.m is essentially the same as main.m but also includes the API for the heuristic estimation of the full JPD

>main-0.1b.m implements the state-of-the-art algorithms in inference for HMMs, filtering, prediction, smoothing, Viterbi, and forward algorithm; plus the comparison between the proposed approach for computing the probabilities of trajectories and the full JPD
